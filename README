- add macros to help with error handling (saber or drift have ex of this)
 - saber https://github.com/saber-hq/vipers/blob/master/vipers/src/assert.rs#L80-L86
 - drift https://github.com/drift-labs/protocol-v1/blob/crispheaney/off-chain-orders/programs/clearing_house/src/error.rs#L122
- also, more macros in general? seems i'm probably doing more work than i need to.

- get rid of circular buffer in favor of PDA per config element
- refactor config/token metadata logic into its own program (token_descriptor)
